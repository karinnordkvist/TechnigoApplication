        <p>Let me guess, you are using a</p>
        <h1><div class="unit">.</div></h1>
      
        <h2>How can I tell? The answer is Breakpoints.</h2>

        <p>
          Depending on which unit you are using when surfing the internet, 
          a well built site will adjust it's design to fit your screen. For example, 
          if you are using an iPhone, the headers would probably be adjusted to fit 
          your screen by shrinking their size, the margins might be a bit smaller because
          the available space is limited and so on. Defining the different formats is done
          by adding <span class="underline">Breakpoints</span> using Media Queries.
        </p> 

        <p style="font-style: italic;" id="note">
          Psst! Try to change the size of your browser window to see if the title changes! 
        </p>
      
        <p>
          To understand the workings of this you could say that all screens have a 
          width of "x" pixels. An iPhone 6 has a width of 750, and a standard 
          laptop screen usually around 1920. By telling the browser to look for 
          a maximum (or minimum) width (or other selector), you can specify how a specific 
          element should appear on one specific device. 
        </p>

        <hr class="solid">

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>
          The syntax used is <span class="underline">@media</span>. To chose which selector that will "activate" a change of
          settings, you type in that chosen selector (for example max-width) and a value within two brackets. 
          Follow these upp with a set of curly brackets in which you add the selectors you wish
          to change. For example:
        </p>
        
        <p class="code">@media (max-width:600px) {<br>
          p {color:red;}
        <br>}</p>

        <p>
          This will change the font color of all text in the p-tag to red, <br>
          on a unit that has a maximum width of 600 pixels.
        </p>
